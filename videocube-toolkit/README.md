# VideoCube & MGIT Python Toolkit

> UPDATE:<br>
> [2024.04.01] Update several missing files for the MGIT train set, based on [issue #6](https://github.com/huuuuusy/videocube-toolkit/issues/6). <br>
> [2023.12.14] Recently, we have proposed a new multi-modal global instance tracking benchmark named ***MGIT***, which consists of 150 long video sequences (all sequences are the same as those in VideoCube-Tiny, but with additional semantic information). This toolkit has been updated to support the MGIT, and you can find a demo in [test_mgit.py](./test_mgit.py). <br>
> [2023.02.08] To make it easier for users to research with VideoCube, we have selected 150 representative sequences from the original version (500 sequences) to form ***VideoCube-Tiny***. This toolkit has been updated to support the VideoCube-Tiny, and you can find a demo to select *tiny* or *full* version in [test_videocube.py](./test_videocube.py). <br>
> [2022.06.20] Update the [SiamFC](https://github.com/huuuuusy/videocube-toolkit/blob/master/tracker/siamfc.py) based on [issue #2](https://github.com/huuuuusy/videocube-toolkit/issues/2) and [issue #3](https://github.com/huuuuusy/videocube-toolkit/issues/3). <br>
> [2022.04.25] Update the [time](https://github.com/huuuuusy/videocube-toolkit/blob/master/videocube/trackers/__init__.py) calculation method based on [issue #1](https://github.com/huuuuusy/videocube-toolkit/issues/1). <br>
> [2022.03.03] Update the toolkit installation, dataset download instructions and a concise example. Now the basic function of this toolkit has been finished. <br>

### Toolkit Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/huuuuusy/videocube-toolkit.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then directly copy the `videocube` folder to your workspace to use it.

### Dataset Download

Please view the [Download](http://videocube.aitestunion.com/downloads) page in the project website.

The VideoCube dataset includes 500 sequences, divided into three subsets (*train*/*val*/*test*). The content distribution in each subset still follows the [6D principle](http://videocube.aitestunion.com/videocube) proposed in the [GIT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13073).

The MGIT dataset includes 150 sequences, divided into three subsets (*train*/*val*/*test*). All sequences in MGIT are the same as those in VideoCube-Tiny, but with additional semantic information. 

The dataset download and file organization process is as follows：

- Download three subsets ([*train*](http://videocube.aitestunion.com/downloads_dataset/train_data)/[*val*](http://videocube.aitestunion.com/downloads_dataset/val_data)/[*test*](http://videocube.aitestunion.com/downloads_dataset/test_data)) and the [*info*](http://videocube.aitestunion.com/downloads_dataset/info) data via [Download](http://videocube.aitestunion.com/downloads) page in the project website.

- Note that we have released a tiny version named VideoCube-Tiny. The original full version includes ***500 sequences (1.4T)***, while the tiny version includes ***150 sequences (344G)***. Based on VideoCube-Tiny, MGIT includes ***150 sequences (344G)*** as well.

- Check the number of files in each subset and run the unzipping script. Before unzipping:

  - the *train* subset of *full version* should include 456 files (455 data files and an unzip_train bash); the *train* subset of *tiny version* should include 129 files (128 data files and an unzip_train bash)

  - the *val* subset of *full version* should include 69 files (68 data files and an unzip_val bash); the *val* subset of *tiny version* should include 22 files (21 data files and an unzip_val bash)

  - the *test* subset of *full version* should include 140 files (139 data files and an unzip_test bash); the *test* subset of *tiny version* should include 41 files (40 data files and an unzip_test bash)

- Run the unzipping script in each subset folder, and delete the script after decompression.

- Taking *val* subset of *full version* as an example, the folder structure should follow:

```
|-- val/
|  |-- 005/
|  |  |-- frame_005/
|  |  |  |-- 000000.jpg/
|  |  |      ......
|  |  |  |-- 016891.jpg/
|  |-- 008/
|  |   ......
|  |-- 486/
|  |-- 493/
```

- Unzip attribute.zip in info data. Attention that we only provide properties files for *train* and *val* subsets. For ground-truth files, we only offer a small number of annotations (restart frames) for sequences that belong to the *test* subset. Please upload the final results to the server for evaluation.

- Rename and organize folders as follows (this example is illustrated for *full version*, while *tiny version* has the similar data structure)：

```
|-- VideoCube/
|  |-- data/
|  |  |-- train/
|  |  |  |-- 002/
|  |  |  |   ......
|  |  |  |-- 499/
|  |  |-- val/
|  |  |  |-- 005/
|  |  |  |   ......
|  |  |  |-- 493/
|  |  |-- test/
|  |  |  |-- 001/
|  |  |  |   ......
|  |  |  |-- 500/
|  |  |-- train_list.txt
|  |  |-- val_list.txt
|  |  |-- test_list.txt
|  |-- attribute/
|  |  |-- absent/
|  |  |-- color_constancy_tran/
|  |  |   ......
|  |  |-- shotcut/

|-- MGIT/
|  |-- data/
|  |  |-- train/
|  |  |  |-- 002/
|  |  |  |   ......
|  |  |  |-- 480/
|  |  |-- val/
|  |  |  |-- 005/
|  |  |  |   ......
|  |  |  |-- 362/
|  |  |-- test/
|  |  |  |-- 001/
|  |  |  |   ......
|  |  |  |-- 498/
|  |-- attribute/
|  |  |-- absent/
|  |  |-- color_constancy_tran/
|  |  |   ......
|  |  |-- shotcut/
```

### A Concise Example

#### VideoCube

[test_videocube.py](./test_videocube.py) is a simple example on how to use the toolkit to define a tracker, run experiments on VideoCube and evaluate performance.

##### How to Define a Tracker?

To define a tracker using the toolkit, simply inherit and override `init` and `update` methods from the [`Tracker`](./videocube/trackers/__init__.py) class. You can find an example in this [page](./tracker/siamfc.py). Here is a simple example:

```Python
from videocube.trackers import Tracker

class IdentityTracker(Tracker):
    def __init__(self):
        super(IdentityTracker, self).__init__(
            name='IdentityTracker',  # tracker name
        )
    
    def init(self, image, box):
        self.box = box

    def update(self, image):
        return self.box
```

##### How to Run Experiments on VideoCube?

Instantiate an [`ExperimentVideoCube`](./videocube/experiments/videocube.py) object, and leave all experiment pipelines to its `run` method:

```Python
from videocube.experiments import ExperimentVideoCube

# ... tracker definition ...

# instantiate a tracker
tracker = IdentityTracker()

# setup experiment (validation subset)
experiment = ExperimentVideoCube(
  root_dir='SOT/VideoCube', # VideoCube's root directory
  save_dir= os.path.join(root_dir,'result'), # the path to save the experiment result
  subset='val', # 'train' | 'val' | 'test'
  repetition=1,
  version='tiny' # set the version as 'tiny' or 'full' 
)
experiment.run(
  tracker, 
  visualize=False,
  save_img=False, 
  method='restart' # method in run function means the evaluation mechanism, you can select the original mode (set none) or the restart mode (set restart)
  )
```

##### How to Evaluate Performance?

For evaluation in OPE mechanism, please use the `report` method of `ExperimentVideoCube` for this purpose:

```Python
# ... run experiments on VideoCube ...

# report tracking performance
experiment.report([tracker.name],attribute_name)
```

For evaluation in R-OPE mechanism, please use the `report` and `report_robust` method of `ExperimentVideoCube` for this purpose:

```Python
# ... run experiments on VideoCube ...

# report tracking performance
experiment.report([tracker.name],attribute_name)
experiment.report_robust([tracker.name])
```

Attention, when evaluated on the __test subset__, you will have to submit your results to the [evaluation server](http://videocube.aitestunion.com/submit_supports) for evaluation. The `report` function will generate a `.zip` file which can be directly uploaded for submission. For more instructions, see [submission instruction](http://videocube.aitestunion.com/submit_supports).

See public evaluation results on [VideoCube's leaderboard (OPE Mechanism)](http://videocube.aitestunion.com/leaderboard) and [VideoCube's leaderboard (R-OPE Mechanism)](http://videocube.aitestunion.com/leaderboard_restart).

#### MGIT

[test_mgit.py](./test_mgit.py) is a simple example on how to use the toolkit to convert tracking results of algorithms based on pytracking framework e.g. JointNLT to MGIT format and evaluate performance.

##### How to Convert Tracking Results?

Most of the existing multi-modal tracking algorithms e.g. JointNLT are based on pytracking framework, and you can easily combine MGIT with them for training and testing with the help of [mgit.py](./mgit/datasets/mgit.py), without spending a lot of time refactoring the algorithm for MGIT. To reduce the difficulty of development, researchers can convert the results on MGIT of any algorithm developed based on the pytracking framework into a format that is easy to evaluate. 

Instantiate an [`ExperimentMGIT`](./mgit/experiments/mgit.py) object, and leave all experiment pipelines to its `convert_results` method:

```python
from mgit.experiments import ExperimentMGIT

# ... path setting ...

# setup experiment (validation subset)
experiment = ExperimentMGIT(
  dataset_dir='/path_to_MGIT', # MGIT's root directory
  save_dir= os.path.join(root_dir,'result'), # the path to save the experiment result
  subset='val', # 'train' | 'val' | 'test'
  repetition=1,
  version='tiny' # temporarily, the toolkit only support tiny version of MGIT
)
experiment.convert_results(
  # the original results path will be "root_dir/tracker_name/original_results_folder", and the converted results will be saved to "root_dir/result"
  root_dir='/path_to_original_results', # the path of tracker e.g. JointNLT results
  tracker_name, # tracker name
  original_results_folder # original result folder name
  )
```

##### How to Evaluate Performance?

For evaluation in OPE mechanism, please use the `report` method of `ExperimentMGIT` for this purpose:

```Python
# ... convert tracking results to MGIT format ...

# report tracking performance
experiment.report([tracker.name],attribute_name)
```

Attention, when evaluated on the __test subset__, you will have to submit your results to the [evaluation server](http://videocube.aitestunion.com/submit_supports) for evaluation. The `report` function will generate a `.zip` file which can be directly uploaded for submission. For more instructions, see [submission instruction](http://videocube.aitestunion.com/submit_supports).
